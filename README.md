#Aestus

Aestus offers an innovative platform allowing scientists to analyze drought risk throughout the world. Our solution features 3 distinct layers visualizing levels of humidity, pressure, and precipitation. As our visualization covers areas all around globe, researchers can analyze drought risk of any location on our planet. In addition to our Deck.gl webmap, we utilized Tensorflow 2.0 to deliver a state-of-the-art artificial neural network (ANN) to predict drought risk when given crowdsourced data. Our model takes in measurements of humidity, temperature, pressure, as well as wind speed to predict drought risk based on the GPCC Drought Index. Through our predictive model and webmap, we hope to deliver essential tools to combat the ongoing climate crisis.
